This code suggests new collection/query terms.  
At the moment, it takes in two corpora. After some minor cleaning, it calculates a rate of change in frequency for each token in the text. If the rate of change for a token is greater than some specified threshold, it returns the token and the rate of change.

Users should provide a list of collection terms used to build the corpora. Users can also provide a list of stopwords. Both of these lists can be modified between running this code once and again.

main.py is the primary code for FlockWatch.  
get_context.py is a supplemental file. It uses the output of trending terms and co-occurrences generated by main.py, then goes into the source of the text to find examples of those terms in context.  
trend_analysis.py is another supplemental file that looks out the output of trending terms and co-occurrences over time.
